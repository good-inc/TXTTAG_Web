<a name="privacy"></a><p><b>How are you protecting my privacy?</b><br>
TXT TAG only knows of tags that have been messaged, or claimed, and does not have a general database of tags. If you claim your tag, TXT TAG collects your email address for delivery purposes only, and in no way reveals your name, email, or any other identifiable information to the people who message you. You are also free to check messages without claiming your tag, or <a href="./leave.php">opt-out</a> at any time if you'd like to leave the service.</p>

<a name="creepers"></a><p><b>What about <a href="http://www.hulu.com/watch/211060" target="_blank">creepers</a>?</b><br>
TXT TAG lets you to restrict the messages that you'll receive to our [PG] list of preset messages (Not yet functional). By not allowing custom messages, we remove the creep factor. If you thought of a preset message that we should add, <a href="./contact.php">let us know</a>!</p>

<a name="competition"></a><p><b>What makes you better than the competition?</b><br>
We aim to excel by delivering to you the best option. We allow sending and receiving immediately, with no membership. We collect only your email address for delivery. We're available on <i>any</i> web-enabled device. Most importantly, we offer the option to restrict custom messages (Not yet functional). TXT TAG is a service that you could trust on your teenager's phones without worrying about them being exposed to profane messages.</p>
<!--<p><a href="http://www.bump.com">BUMP.com</a>, <a href="http://www.emailacar.com">Email-A-Car</a>, <a href="http://www.pl8scan.com">PL8SCAN.com</a>, <a href="http://www.plateside.com">Plateside</a>, and the already failed WhyHonk.com, all have active implementations, but fail to provide the proper value to you, the user. BUMP.com is trying to do much more than simply messaging plates, and their grand efforts have them failing at basic usability requirements. Email-A-Car blatantly endorsees raunchy messages. PL8SCAN.com is no longer functional. Plateside is the nicest option we've seen, but, like BUMP.com, they require unnecessary identifiable information about your vehicle.</p>-->

<a name="driving"></a><p><b>Can I use TXT TAG while driving?</b><br>
We recommend you follow your local state law regarding texting while driving, which most likely prohibits the use of our service by the driver. Any passenger in your vehicle, though, is free to use the service while the car is in motion.</p>

<a name="reply"></a><p><b>Why can't I reply?</b><br>
For now, TXT TAG is a send-only service. We'll introduce the ability to reply in the future!</p>

<a name="public"></a><p><b>Can anybody view messages sent to my tag?</b><br>
Until a tag is claimed, yes, anybody can type in a tag and see all of messages ever sent to it. You can choose to restrict public viewing of your messages when signing up (this will eventually be a PRO feature).</p>

<a name="free"></a><p><b>Will you always be free?</b><br>
Yes, though we'll restrict some convenient features to pro accounts in the future. Claiming one tag per email, and the sending of messages, will always be free.</p>

<a name="pro"></a><p><b>How do you make money?</b><br>
TXT TAG collects ad revenue when you use our site, or apps, which allows us to offer this service for free. We'll also offer a PRO account with nice features such as sending custom messages & replies, claiming up to 5 tags on a single email address, receiving messages at multiple emails, restricting your messages from public viewing, and of course, an ad-free experience.</p>

<a name="paid"></a><p><b>I own a lot of vehicles (fleet, rental, hauling, etc...), can we work something out?</b><br>
Absolutely! We'd love to work with you and can offer a means to easily claim many tags at once. For this service, and to receive messages for multiple tags at a single email, we charge a small fee of $1/tag/year. You also receive access to all of the pro features listed above.</p>

<a name="prevmsg"></a><p><b>If I sign up, will I still receive all of my previous messages?</b><br>
Yes, once you sign up you'll receive a single email containing all of your existing messages.</p>

<a name="nomsg"></a><p><b>I signed up and never got my messages. Why!?</b><br>
You might've typed your tag, or your email, incorrectly when signing up. Hotmail may also have put our emails in your spam folder, be sure to add info@txttag.me to your approved senders list. <a href="./contact.php">Contact us</a> to work this out, your messages are still safely stored, waiting to be read by you.</p>

<a name="leave"></a><p><b>Can I opt-out of receiving messages once I've signed up?</b><br>
Not sure why you would, but it's easy enough via our <a href="./leave.php">opt-out</a> page. If you've claimed multiple tags with one email, you can remove your email entirely, or remove just one specific tag.</p>

<a name="Oh"></a><p><b>How do I know if that's an O or 0 on my plate?</b><br>
It's okay, we standardize all tags by changing O's (oh's) to 0's (zero's), B's (bee's) to 8's (eight's) and I's (eye's) to 1's (one's). This is in line with most state's own practices. We also remove spaces and change all characters to upper case to mitigate any and all confusion.</p>

<a name="international"></a><p><b>Does this service work internationally?</b><br>
We only allow US plates right now, but that's an exciting question! Please, show us your interest by <a href="./contact.php">sending us a message</a>, and be sure to tell us what country you're in.</p>

<a name="plain"></a><p><b>Why does everything look so... plain?</b><br>
You've stumbled upon TXT TAG in its infancy, where function is prioritized over form. We'll make it look pretty in due time; send us some encouragement through our <a href="./contact.php">feedback form</a>!</p>
